# Forecasting the outflow of bank customers.
## Project description:
Customers began to leave the bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Bank marketers have calculated that it is cheaper to retain current customers than to attract new ones.
It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on the behavior of customers and termination of contracts with the bank are presented
## Project objectives 🎯:
Based on the data from the bank to determine the client who can leave
## Brief conclusion from the project✍️:
During the study, several types of models were trained, these are Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
The indicators of the F1 metric were also studied for various samples, balanced, upsampled and downsampled, as a result of which the most optimal Random Forest model was found with F1 metric ~0.6
